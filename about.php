<p>College Choice helps students and their families find the college program that meets their needs. Our resources include college rankings, lists of the best colleges by state, and program rankings at the undergraduate and graduate levels. These rankings use a custom methodology that takes a student-centered approach. By weighing factors like median student debt and average graduate salaries, our rankings help prospective students make informed choices. We also publish guides, college planning resources, information on paying for college, and career planning tools. Students interested in particular career paths can use our resources to learn about educational requirements, earning potential, and job demand. Our financial aid resources help students identify scholarships and save money on college. College Choice sets high editorial standards and draws on reputable sources, including higher education information from the federal government, to create practical and reliable resources for college students.</p>
